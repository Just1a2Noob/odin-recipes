    <p>
      For this I recommend getting a bit fancier or expensive coffee, since they
      usually have unique tastes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        In a jar, put in about 40gr of coffee and 400gr water, about 10gr water
        per-gr of coffee. This will create about 2 cups of coffee. If you want
        to add milk to coffee I suggest changing the ratio to 5-8gr of water
        per-gram of coffee.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the jar on the countertop for about 12 hours. If you want a slower
        brew put it in the refridgerator for about 24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 12 hours, filter out the coffee with cheese cloth or paper filter.
        The filtered coffee should have a dark muddy look, that ok. Some types
        of coffee produce darker or lighter depending on the coffee beans used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you can enjoy some delicious cold brew coffee! Simple and easy.
