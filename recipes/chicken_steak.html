    <p>
      For steak I recommend using chiken thighs, since they absorb marination
      well and will result in a juicy chicken.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Slice the chicken things to medium sized pieces, about 4-8cm in length,
        the thickness of the piece should be around ~1cm.
      </li>
      <li>
        After that prepare put the chicken with the marinade. For the marinade
        it can be anything you want, honey and garlic or teriyaki sauce with
        ginger, anything sweet, spicy, or salty will go well
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate the chicken for about 12 - 24 hours, and before cooking take it
        out 20-30 minutes before cooking it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a skillet or iron cast to seer the chiken, use low heat to cook the
        chiken insides, and when you feel like its good a time to add some char,
        use high heat to give it an appetizing look
      </li>
    </ul>
