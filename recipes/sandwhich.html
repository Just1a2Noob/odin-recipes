    <ul>
      <li>First get some boule or bastad bread</li>
      <li>
        Second pick your favorite fillings, most common are cheese and beef
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, we toast the bread to our liking. When toasting bread its best to
        be in an enclosed pan, so that the steam is trapped inside creating a
        crispy and soft toast
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, we put the fillings on the toasted side of the bread and repeat
        the toasting process, to get our delicious bread
      </li>
    </ul>
